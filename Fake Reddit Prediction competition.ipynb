The stemming technique is not used for production purposes because it is not so efficient technique and most of the time it stems the unwanted words. So, to solve the problem another technique came into the market as Lemmatization. there are various types of stemming algorithms like porter stemmer, snowball stemmer.

        "\n",
        "Because classification models cannot deal with text data directly, we need to convert our comments to a numeric representation. As mentioned before, there are several ways to achieve this. [This article](https://medium.com/@paritosh_30025/natural-language-processing-text-data-vectorization-af2520529cf7) provides a concise overview. All methods have in common that they assign each unique word in a document a unique number. A vector of numbers is created in which each element represents a word. Logically, the length of the vector will equal the number of unique words. In the simplest form (bag of words), a sentence can be represented by such a vector by indicating the presence of a word using a 1 in the appropriate index representing the word. All elements standing for words not included in the sentence will be 0.   \n",
        "Frequency methods improve on this very basic approach. For many applications, `TF-IDF` (term frequency, inverse document frequency) is a good choice. In our case, the `TF` part summarizes how often a word appears in a comment in relation to all words. As was mentioned earlier, that is not always a sufficient indicator for a useful word as it might be overly general or be used inflationary in many comments. This is where the `IDF` part comes into play. It downscales words that are prevalent in many other comments. Consequently, words that are frequent in a comment and also specific to it (i.e. they are uncommon in other comments) will get a high weight. Unspecific words or those with a low overall frequency will get a low weight.    \n",
        "This is how we apply `TF-IDF` to our comments using `scikit-learn`: "

        "We've learned that linear SVC is a solid model choice and delivers great results out of the box. Still, we might be able to improve upon those by taking a more guided approach to choosing parameters. To do so, we will compare different parameters for feature creation as well as modeling. We can achieve this by making use of the pipeline and grid search functionality in sci-kit learn.  \n",
        "The `Pipeline` object encapsulates several processing steps into one. The last step in a pipeline must have a `fit()` functionality. The previous steps a `transform()` and `fit()` functionality. The `Pipeline` object itself has the same `fit()`, `transform()` and `predict()` methods as any other model in scikit-learn. Thus, we can streamline the whole process of feature creation, model fitting and prediction into one step.  \n",
        "With `GridSearchCV` we can define parameter spaces for our functions. All parameter combinations will be evaluated against one another in a cross validation using a defined score metric. Next, we combine our pipeline with grid search. In result, we can jointly test combinations of parameters in feature creation and model training:"

        "The output of sci-kit's `classification_report` provides us with several metrics. For unbalanced data sets `accuracy` is an inappropriate metric. Since it's value solely tells you how many cases have been properly classified, a high value can be achieved by always predicting the majority class. In contrast, the `f1-score` puts precision and recall of each class in relation to each other. As such, it is a more fine grained measure. We can use an aggregate version of it to have a single metric summarizing the performance of each model. For example, the `weighted f1-score` is an average of the `f1-scores` of both our classes taking the class distribution into account. On the other hand, the `macro f1-score` averages over class scores without weighing them. Consequently, we'll use that as we wish to give the same importance to both our classes. This is because even though bad grades are much more rare they also have a more severe impact.   \n",
        "All methods achieve impressive results predicting the good ratings class with `f1-scores` above 0.95. However, results for the bad ratings class are much lower and vary wildly.  \n",
        "Here, the ensemble methods, i.e. RandomForest and XGBoost, perform worst. However, with some more effort to tune their parameters they would probably fare significantly better.  \n",
        "As a general rule of thumb, logistic regressions deliver decent results in many different use cases. Moreover, they are simple to apply, robust and computationally efficient. Our results support this claim as the logistic regression achieves the third best result with an `macro f1-score` of 0.88. This result is only surpassed by the linear SVC and MLP that both score 0.9. In general, SVC is comparable in speed and simplicity to the logistic regression. In addition, it often performs very well in classification tasks as we can see here. In contrast, Neural Networks perform extremely well in all sorts of tasks but are also much more complex and slow all around. Because of this, we will stick to the LinearSVC classifier for now."

Although the meaning can still be grasped, humans will probably have a harder time understanding these sentences. In contrast, many classification approaches greatly benefit from this simplification. Some reasons for that have been mentioned above. Basically, it boils down to the fact that we try to keep only informative pieces of text that aid the **specific model** we intend to apply to the task. In this case, we will use simple models that benefit from less complexity. However, more advanced models are able to extract information from more complex features. Thus, they can perform better with less simplification of the input texts. We'll take a look at that in an upcoming post."
